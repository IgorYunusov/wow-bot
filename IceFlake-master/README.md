## About
This is a small project aimed to provide a simple memory editing framework for the World of Warcraft 3.3.5a client. The framework is written in C# with .NET 4.0. The code is pretty self-explanatory, and is (in my humble opinion) easy to read. I've tried to structure the framework as logical as I could. The framework is injected. The reason this project is being put on GitHub is to encourage other users to parttake in the developement. The source consists highly of other peoples contributions and shares.

## Requirements
* WoW 3.3.5a
* Programming knowledge
* Optional: [SlimDX](http://slimdx.org/)

## Usage
Check out the source, open the solution, add the missing references, compile and you should be good to go.
