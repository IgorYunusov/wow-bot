## Attention

You need to set the static Blackmagic instace before you use anything, otherwise it won't work properly. This instance is used in 90% of the actions.

For some actions you need to Hook WoW's Endscene function to execute stuff on WoW's main thread if you use one of these methods, please set the static Property of AmeisenHook to a hooked instance of the AmeisenHook class.
